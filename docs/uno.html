                        <p>In the fascinating world of video games, software installation is a fundamental step to enjoy the exciting adventures they offer. But have you ever wondered how this installation process takes place? In this context, the need arises for specialized installers that simplify and expedite the process, allowing players to quickly immerse themselves in their virtual worlds.</p>
                        <p>Each video game requires a unique installation process, tailored to both the program itself and the computer on which it will run. For this reason, developers often include an installer, a program designed specifically to perform all the necessary tasks during installation. These installers are responsible for copying or generating the necessary code from the installation files, creating new files in the local system.
</p>
                        <p>The importance of an efficient installer lies in its ability to facilitate the operating system's access to the software, as well as creating directories and registering environment variables necessary for proper functioning. Furthermore, a well-designed installer also provides a separate uninstallation program that goes beyond simply deleting the game folder, as it may involve modifying or removing registry files and other system components for a complete uninstallation.
</p>
                        <p>When it comes to video game installation, speed and simplicity are crucial. To achieve this, developers turn to the creation of installation packages, which compress and store all the necessary files and folders into a single executable. This installation package includes an .msi file that contains an installation database, summarized information flows, and data flows for different parts of the installation. It may also include transformations, internal and external source files, as well as cabinet files required during the installation process.
</p>
                        <p>To carry out this task of creating installation packages, a technique known as "Application Packaging" is used. This practice involves preparing structured and standardized software installations intended for automated deployment. Microsoft has developed the Microsoft Windows Installer (MSI) service as part of its desktop operating systems, allowing video game developers to leverage this tool to create efficient and reliable installers.

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Types</h2>
                        <p><b>Executable File-Based Installers (EXE):</b> EXE installers are very common and widely used. They allow the installation of a game through an executable file. These installers can include customization options such as selecting the language, installation directory, and desired components to install.
</p>
                        <p><b>Disk Image-Based Installers (ISO): </b>Disk image-based installers are created by packaging all the game files into an ISO disk image. Users can mount the disk image on a virtual drive and run the installer from there. This type of installer is common in PC games and usually includes all the necessary dependencies.
</p>
 <p><b>Package-Based Installers (PKG):</b> This type of installer is common on platforms like macOS and PlayStation. PKG installers package the game and its resources into a specific package file for the operating system. Then, the user can run the package to install the game on their system.

</p>
 <p><b>Digital Distribution Client-Based Installers:</b> Many modern games are distributed through digital distribution platforms like Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG, among others. These platforms provide their own installation clients that handle the download and setup of the game on the user's system. These installers are often automatic and offer a simplified installation experience.

</p>
 <p><b>Script-Based Installers:</b> Some games use custom installation scripts that run in a specific interpreter. These scripts can perform various actions, such as extracting files, copying resources, modifying configurations, among others. Script-based installers allow for greater flexibility and customization during the installation process.
