                        <p> Microsoft Windows Installer, also known as MSI or Windows Installer, is an installer package file format used by Windows. The installer service enables customers to provide a better corporate implementation and provides a standard format for component management. 
 <p>MSI files are used for installation, storage and removal of programs. This MSI files are database files, used by Windows Installer, and they contain information about an application which is divided into features and components, and every component may hold files, registry data, shortcuts, etc. 
</p>
 <p> MSI files are executed by an EXE file that is part of Windows, called MSIEXEC.EXE. This application reads the data in the MSI file and executes the installation.
</p>
                       
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Windows Installer functions
</h2>
<p>The Windows Installer service was designed to support every phase of the application management life cycle, providing a service to support each step involved in managing a desktop application from deployment through retirement. To support these functions, the Windows Installer needs to receive instructions from an installation package.

</p></div>
<p>Windows Installer has many built-in functions that will save you time and effort:


</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">MSI Files and Components
</h2>
                        <p><b>.msi file:</b>  A file with .msi extension is a simple database file that can be read by Microsoft Windows Installer service contained in all recent versions of Microsoft Windows. The database contains the files, registry and instructions to the Windows Installer service in order to install the application.

</p>
                        <p><b>Msiexec.exe: </b> The Msiexec.exe program is a component of Windows Installer. When it is called by Setup, Msiexec.exe uses Msi.dll to read the package (.msi) files, apply any transform (.mst) files, and incorporate command-line options supplied by Setup. The installer performs all installation-related tasks, including copying files to the hard disk, making registry modifications, creating shortcuts on the desktop, and displaying dialog boxes to prompt for user installation preferences when necessary. When Windows Installer is installed on a computer, it changes the registered file type of .msi files so that if you double-click an .msi file, Msiexec.exe runs with that file.

</p>
 <p><b>MSI Extensions:</b> Each installation package includes an .msi file containing the installation database, a summary information stream, and data streams for various parts of the installation. The .msi file can also contain one or more transforms, internal source files, and external source files or cabinet files required by the installation.

<h2 class="section-heading">Signing an Application Packaging
</h2>
 <p>First of all, it is important to understand what digital signature means. A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents. Digital signatures are a standard element of the most cryptographic protocol suites, and are commonly used for software distribution, financial transactions, contract management software, and in other cases where it is important to detect forgery or tampering.
</p>
  <p>Signing an application package provides the user with verification that the application data has not been modified after being signed, while confirming the identity of the user or the company that signed it. Therefore, signing an Application Packaging files is an important thing since you help ensure that tampered files are not installed on end-user computers.
</p>
   <p>There are many methods and ways to approach this topic. Since we are making use of .msi files for the deployment of applications, the best option at the moment is SignTool.exe. SignTool is a command line tool that is used to sign an application package or a set of applications with a certificate.
We need Microsoft Windows SDK to be able to work with SignTool.exe. The tool is installed in the Bin folder of the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) installation path.
</p>
 <p>You need to follow this steps:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the certificate you want to sign the file with in the development computer.</li>
<li>Open a Visual Studio command prompt.</li>
<li>Change to the directory that contains the .msi file.</li>
<li>Sign the .msi file using the following
 command: >><b>signtool sign /sha1 CertificateHash SetupNameFile.msi</b><<
</li>
</ul>
